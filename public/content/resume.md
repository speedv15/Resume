I make complex technology usable at scale. As Medtronic's training architect for Deep Brain Stimulation, I've spent 10 years building bridges between breakthrough neurotechnology and the clinicians who use it worldwide. The first DBS system that could sense the brain. The first that adapts to what it senses. The largest commercial brain-computer interface launch in history. Through all of it, the pattern is the same: dream what adoption looks like, simplify what blocks it, communicate until the bridge is built.
